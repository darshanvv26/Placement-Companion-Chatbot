Hardware Engineer conducts research, definition, design, verification & documentation for SoC (System on a Chip) development.

Performs Logic design for integration of cell libraries, functional units, and sub-systems into SoC full chip designs. Register Transfer Level coding, and simulation for SoCs.

Contributes to the development of multidimensional designs involving the layout of complex integrated circuits.

Will be working on aspects of the SoC design flow from high-level design to synthesis, place and route, timing, and power to create a design database that is ready for manufacturing.

Initiates, guides, and coordinates overall design and development of new ideas and products.

He/She should be willing to ramp up quickly on required areas like RTL, Verification/Validation, Structural Design/Physical Design, Analog, Firmware, Embedded etc.
